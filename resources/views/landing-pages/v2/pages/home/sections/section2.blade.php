                    <h4>Our dental clinic has been founded in 2010. The founder is an honorable alumni of NYC's Columbia medical school - Mark Hoffmann, MD.</h4>
                    <p>After 8 previous years of practicing, he and his colleagues collaborated to found their own clinic. Coming from backgrounds of miscellaneous dental institutions of the US, they complement each other. Their common clinic became known as DentalPlus!</p>
                    <p>The state of Pennsylvania highly appreciates our contribution to state's dental healthcare. Just as our local patients in the upstate Potter county of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>We combine extensive record of practical experience with an equal focus on customer service approach. In the last 6 years, our dental clinic grew a list of returning clients!</p>
                    <p class="text-bold text-italic">We look forward to you becoming one of them as well!</p>
